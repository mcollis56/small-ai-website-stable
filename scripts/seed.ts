Welcome! You're about to learn how AI can save you hours every week.

## What You'll Learn

- How to write AI prompts that actually work
- Building your first automation
- Practical tools you can use today
- How to stay sane while adopting AI

## Course Structure

This workshop is broken into 6 modules. Each builds on the last, but you can revisit any module anytime.

## Time Commitment

The full workshop takes about 60-90 minutes to complete. But you don't have to do it all at once.

## What AI Actually Is

AI isn't magic. It's pattern recognition at scale.

Think of it like having an extremely well-read assistant who:
- Has read everything on the internet
- Never gets tired
- Can process information incredibly fast
- But sometimes makes confident mistakes

## What AI Is Good At

‚úÖ **Writing and editing** - Emails, blog posts, social media  
‚úÖ **Research and summarizing** - Turning long documents into bullet points  
‚úÖ **Repetitive tasks** - Data entry, formatting, scheduling  
‚úÖ **Brainstorming** - Generating ideas and options  
‚úÖ **Customer support** - Answering common questions

## What AI Struggles With

‚ùå Truly original creative work  
‚ùå Complex reasoning across multiple steps  
‚ùå Understanding context and nuance (sometimes)  
‚ùå Knowing what it doesn't know  

## The Small Business Advantage

Big companies are slow to adopt AI because of:
- Compliance issues
- Integration challenges
- Corporate bureaucracy

**You can move faster.** That's your edge.

      title: 'Module 2: Writing Prompts That Work',
      description: 'The art and science of getting AI to do what you want',
      content: `# Module 2: Writing Prompts That Work

## The Prompt Formula

Good prompts have three parts:

1. **Context** - Who you are, what you're trying to do
2. **Task** - What you want the AI to do
3. **Format** - How you want the output

### Example: Bad Prompt
"Write a blog post about AI"

### Example: Good Prompt
"I run a small bakery in Portland. Write a 300-word blog post explaining how we use AI to manage inventory and reduce waste. Make it conversational and authentic, not corporate. Include a specific example."

## The Power of Specificity

The more specific you are, the better the output.

### Template You Can Use
"I'm a [your role] who needs to [your goal]. Write a [format] that [specific requirement]. The tone should be [tone description]."

## Common Mistakes

1. **Being too vague** - "Make this better" ‚Üí Better how?
2. **No constraints** - Without limits, AI will ramble
3. **Wrong tone** - Specify the voice you want
4. **Not iterating** - Your first prompt rarely works perfectly

## Prompt Library

Here are 5 prompts you can use today:

### 1. Email Response
"I received this email: [paste email]. Write a friendly but professional response that [your goal]. Keep it under 100 words."

### 2. Social Media Post
"Turn this information into a LinkedIn post: [paste info]. Make it engaging, not salesy. Add a hook in the first line."

### 3. Meeting Summary
"Summarize these meeting notes into action items: [paste notes]. List who's responsible for each task."

### 4. Customer FAQ
"A customer asked: [question]. Write a helpful response that [addresses their concern]. Include [specific information]."

### 5. Content Repurposing
"Turn this blog post into 5 social media posts: [paste excerpt]. Each should be self-contained and under 150 characters."

**Your Turn:** Try one of these prompts with your own content.

- **Superhuman** ($30/month, powerful)
- **ChatGPT** (paste emails, get summaries)

### The Workflow
1. Open your inbox
2. Select 5-10 emails
3. Ask AI: "Categorize these emails by priority and draft 2-sentence replies for the routine ones"
4. Review and send

**Time saved:** 20 minutes/day = 2 hours/week

## Automation #2: Meeting Summaries

**Problem:** You take notes during meetings but never read them again.

**Solution:** Record meetings (with permission) and auto-generate action items.

### Tools You Can Use
- **Otter.ai** (free tier available)
- **Fireflies.ai** (integrates with Zoom)
- **Notion AI** (if you use Notion)

### The Workflow
1. Record your meeting
2. AI transcribes automatically
3. Review the summary (2 minutes)
4. Export action items to your task manager

**Time saved:** 15 minutes/meeting

## Automation #3: Social Media Repurposing

**Problem:** You write a newsletter but don't have time to post on social media.

**Solution:** One piece of content ‚Üí Multiple formats.

### The Workflow
1. Write your newsletter/blog post
2. Paste into ChatGPT: "Turn this into 3 LinkedIn posts, 5 tweets, and 2 Instagram captions"
3. Review and schedule using Buffer or Later

**Time saved:** 45 minutes/week

## Your Action Plan

Pick ONE automation to implement this week:
- [ ] Email triage
- [ ] Meeting summaries
- [ ] Content repurposing

Don't try to do everything at once. Master one, then add another.

      title: 'Module 5: Common Mistakes & How To Avoid Them',
      description: 'Learn from others\' mistakes and save yourself time',
      content: `# Module 5: Common Mistakes & How To Avoid Them

## Mistake #1: Trying To Do Everything At Once

**What happens:** You sign up for 10 tools, create accounts, get overwhelmed, give up.

**Fix:** Pick ONE use case. Master it. Then add another.

Start with: "I want AI to help me with [specific task]"

## Mistake #2: Not Reviewing AI Output

**What happens:** AI writes something incorrect or off-brand. You publish it. Embarrassment ensues.

**Fix:** Always review and edit.

AI is a starting point, not a finish line.

### Checklist Before Hitting Send
- [ ] Factually accurate?
- [ ] Sounds like me/my brand?
- [ ] No weird phrasing?
- [ ] Includes specific details (not generic)?

## Mistake #3: Using AI For The Wrong Tasks

**Bad uses of AI:**
- Strategic decisions (AI can't understand your business context)
- Legal advice (seriously, don't)
- Anything that requires empathy and human judgment
- Tasks where accuracy is critical (finance, medical, legal)

**Good uses of AI:**
- First drafts
- Brainstorming
- Summarizing
- Repetitive tasks
- Research starting points

## Mistake #4: Forgetting About Data Privacy

**Don't paste:**
- Customer data
- Financial information
- Passwords or credentials
- Confidential business information

**Why:** Free AI tools use your input to train their models.

**Safe option:** Use privacy-focused tools (ChatGPT Plus, Claude Pro) for sensitive work.

## Mistake #5: Expecting Perfection

AI will:
- Make mistakes
- Misunderstand context
- Generate bland content sometimes
- Require iteration

**That's normal.**

The goal isn't perfection. It's saving time while maintaining quality.

## Mistake #6: Not Saving Good Prompts

When you write a prompt that works well, save it.

**Create a prompt library:**
1. Open a Google Doc or Notion page
2. Title it "AI Prompts That Work"
3. Every time you get a great result, save the prompt
4. Organize by category (Email, Social Media, Research, etc.)

## Mistake #7: Giving Up Too Soon

**Reality check:** The first month is clunky.

You'll:
- Write bad prompts
- Get weird outputs
- Wonder if it's worth it

**Push through.** By week 3-4, it clicks.

## Your Prevention Plan

Before moving forward:
- [ ] I'll start with ONE automation
- [ ] I'll always review AI output before using it
- [ ] I'll keep sensitive data out of AI tools
- [ ] I'll save prompts that work
- [ ] I'll give it 30 days before judging results

## Common Questions

**Q: Should I learn to code?**  
A: Probably not. Focus on prompt engineering and tool selection.

**Q: Will AI replace my job?**  
A: No. But someone who uses AI well might.

**Q: How much time will I save?**  
A: Most people save 3-5 hours/week after the first month. Some save more.

**Q: What if I don't "get it"?**  
A: You will. Give it 30 days of consistent use.

## Final Thoughts

AI won't solve all your problems.

But it will give you back time. Time to:
- Focus on strategy
- Talk to customers
- Build your business
- Take a proper lunch break

**That's the goal.**

Not to replace humans. To free humans from the boring bits.
